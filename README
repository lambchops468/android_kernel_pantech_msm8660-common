Kernel for Pantech Burst P9070 (Board name "Presto")

These instructions are based off the README which accompanies the LG P769BK
v20h source code, located at
https://www.lg.com/global/support/opensource/opensourceList?types=ALL&search=P769
and the offical AOSP instructions at
https://source.android.com/source/building-kernels
 
How to build:
1. Obtain compiler from Android project:
1a. Get android’s ‘repo’ http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html
1b. Run
      repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-4.4.4_r1
1c. Run
      repo sync platform/prebuilt
2. Build the Kernel
2a. In the kernel directory, Run
      ARCH=arm
      CROSS_COMPILE=../android-4.4.4_r1-prebuilt/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.7/bin/arm-eabi-
      make -j4 zImage modules
    This will use the .config located at the root of this repository.
    The .config located at the root of this repository is based off the config that
    LG uses to build their official kernel. This can be found at
    arch/arm/configs/cyanogenmod_presto_defconfig or on the phone the kernel is
    booted at /proc/config.gz

2b. Alternatively, in the kernel directory, Run
      ./build_kernel.sh
    This uses the config at arch/arm/configs/cyanogenmod_presto_defconfig
