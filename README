Kernel for Pantech Burst P9070 (Board name "Presto")

These instructions are based off the README which accompanies the LG P769BK
v20h source code, located at
https://www.lg.com/global/support/opensource/opensourceList?types=ALL&search=P769
and the offical AOSP instructions at
https://source.android.com/source/building-kernels
 
How to build:
1. Obtain compiler from Android project:
1a. Get android’s ‘repo’ http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html
1b. Run
      repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-4.4.4_r1
1c. Run
      repo sync platform/prebuilt
2. In the kernel directory, Run
      ARCH=arm
      CROSS_COMPILE=../android-4.4.4r1-prebuilt/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.7/bin/arm-eabi-
      make -j4 zImage modules


The .config located at the root of this repository is based off the config that
LG uses to build their official kernel. This can be found at
arch/arm/configs/cyanogenmod_presto_defconfig or on the phone the kernel is
booted at /proc/config.gz
